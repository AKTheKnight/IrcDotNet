Overview
========

IRC.NET is a complete IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client library for the
.NET Framework 4.0 and Silverlight 4. It aims to provide a complete and
efficient implementation of the protocol as described in RFC 2812
(Internet Relay Chat: Client Protocol) as well as supporting de-facto modern
features of the protocol, as described below.

Mono
----

The .NET Framework library is also intended to compile and run under Mono 2.6
and later.

The Silverlight library is not guaranteed to compile or run on the Moonlight
framework.

Non-RFC Features
----------------

 * Parsing of ISUPPORT parameters (draft specification at
   <http://www.irc.org/tech_docs/draft-brocklesby-irc-isupport-03.txt>).
   Interpretation of parameters is left to the user.
 
 * CTCP (Client-To-Client Protocol) support (specification at
   <http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/ctcpspec.html>).
   Common commands are supported.
