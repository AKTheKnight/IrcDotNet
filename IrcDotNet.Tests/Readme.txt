Instructions for Running Tests
==============================

IMPORTANT:
Do not run any individual tests in this project, as most will fail because they are not begun in the required state.
You should only run the CompleteIrcClient ordered test, which is designed to execute the unit tests in a fixed order
with pre-defined conditions and timeouts.
